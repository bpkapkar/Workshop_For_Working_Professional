            "Machine Learning (ML) is a sub-field of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms and statistical models which enable computers to perform a task without being explicitly programmed for every rule. Instead, the system learns patterns from data and uses those patterns to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.\n",

            "   - Supervised learning: The model learns from labeled examples (input-output pairs). Common tasks are classification and regression.\n",

            "   - Reinforcement learning: An agent learns by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.\n",

            "Common algorithms include linear and logistic regression, decision trees, support-vector machines, neural networks, k-means clustering, and many more. Deep learning, a subset of ML, uses large multi-layer neural networks and has driven breakthroughs in image recognition, natural-language processing, and game playing.\n",

        "1. **Agentic RAG is Dynamic:** Unlike linear RAG pipelines, Agentic RAG uses an LLM-powered agent to dynamically decide what actions to take, such as choosing the right tool for a given query.\n",

        "2. **Tools are the Agent's Actions:** The core of an Agentic RAG system is giving the agent a set of tools. The create_retriever_tool function is a simple way to wrap any data retriever into a tool the agent can use.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **LangGraph for Cyclical Workflows:** LangGraph is the key library for building agentic systems. It allows you to define your workflow as a state graph with nodes (actions) and conditional edges (logic), enabling loops and complex decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Self-Correction for Robustness:** This advanced workflow shows a self-corrective pattern. By adding nodes to grade the relevance of retrieved documents and rewrite the query if needed, the agent can recover from a poor initial retrieval, making the system much more robust.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **State Management:** The AgentState object acts as the agent's memory, persisting information across the different nodes and cycles of the graph."
